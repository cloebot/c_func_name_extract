# Extract Function Name in C/C++ Source Codes

This is a simple project to extract the function names in C/C++ source codes. It should work well for C codes, but may have problems for C++ codes. It is written in Python. Please let me know if you find any bugs.

Usage:
    python func_name_extract.py <file_path> <output_file>

    <file_path> is the source code file (e.g. helloWorld.c) you want to extract.

    <output_file> is the file to store the result
